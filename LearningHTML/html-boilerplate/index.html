    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <p>
        index.html is the homepage. 
        !DOCTYPE html gets HTML5 (latest version).
        
    </p>
    <p>
        html is the root element.
        lang specifies language (en = english).
        meta charset="utf-8" makes sure website displays special symbols correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Head gives important meta-information about the webpage plus stuff to render correctly in the browser.
        Don't put elements that display content in head.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Body holds all content displayed to users.
        Use p for paragraphs and to add white space and breaks on website. White space on code does not mean white space on webpage.
        Press ! and first option for a boiler plate shortcut.

        Maybe use an html validator online to check your code for syntax errors.
