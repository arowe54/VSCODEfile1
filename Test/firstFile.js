let message; // declares a variable called message
message = 'Hello'; // stores String in message

alert(message); // prints message to screen

let user = 'John Rowe';
age = 25;
message = 'Hello';

// can also do this
let user = 'Andrew Rowe',
    age = 18,
    message = 'hello';

// var is basically the same as let

let hello = 'Hello World';
message = hello; // copies 'Hello World' from hello into message
alert(hello);
alert(message); // prints 'Hello World' twice

// variables can only be letters, digits, $ or _
// cannot start with a digit
// use camelCase

// can use any language, including cryllic and chinese symbols. should use english (national convention)

// let, class, return, and function are reserved (cannot use)

/*
older versions of js could use variables without defining them.
If you put 'use strict', you have to declare variables
*/

// constants
const myBirthday = '16.06.2004';

// constants are good for difficult to remember values (ex. colours in hexadecimal)
const COLOUR_RED = "#F00";
const COLOUR_GREEN = "#0F0";
const COLOUR_BLUE = "#00F";
const COLOUR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";
let colourGreen = COLOR_GREEN;
alert(colourGreen)

// if it is not known before loading the file, use regular camelCase

// variable advice from https://javascript.info/variables
/*
Use readable names,
stay away from abbreviations / short names (ex. a, b)
make it descriptive and concise
make it make sense (ex. if a user is a user, name variables like newUser instead of newVisitor)
use different variables for different values so debugging is easier
*/


// operators are the basically the same as java
// ** are for exponents
